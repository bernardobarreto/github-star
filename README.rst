Github-Star
-----------

Github-Star adds a "Star" button next to the numbers of "forks" and "watchers" at the page of a repository.
What is this button for ?
Sometimes I want to keep the reference of a repository without watching it.
I could add it into my browser's favorite, but that sucks.

The starred repositories will appear in your dashboard above your repositories.

The bad part:
    Your starred repos only appear in your browser, because Github-Star uses
    the localStorage of your browser.

Install
+++++++
Github-Star is not avaliable on chrome store yet,
but you can use it in developer mode.
