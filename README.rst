RepoStapler
-----------

RepoStapler adds a "Clip" button next to the numbers of "forks" and "watchers" at the page of a repository.
What is this button for ?
Sometimes I want to keep the reference of a repositorie without watch it.
I could add into my browser's favorite, but that sucks.

The clipped repositories will appear in your dashboard above your repositories.

The bad part:
    Your clipped repos only appear in your browser, because RepoStapler uses
    the localStorage of the browser.

Install
+++++++
RepoStapler is not avaliable on chrome store yet,
but you can use it in developer mode.


Feel free to create issue, comment or contribute.
Thanks.
